# Relational Database Management Systems

RDBMS are a class of systems that provide an interface to store data in a format that is heavily influenced by *relations*. The primary tenet of such a system is that the data is completely based on their relations among one another. This lets us define the structure of the way data is going to be stored more comprehensively so that things are clear. This also allows us to set up certain preordained restrictions that act as constraints on the data that is about to be entered. This provides a cohesive and secure interface for operations on data.
