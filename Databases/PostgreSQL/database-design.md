# Relational Database Design Techniques

Every successful relational database is designed by following a set standard of modelling a database. The steps involved in design are:
1. **Requirements Collection and Analysis**: Needs and purpose of the project is realised.
1. **Conceptual Database Design**: Database design is planned initially. This is the part where ER diagrams are helpful.
1. **Logical Database Design**: Database designs are converted from the ER diagrams to the Relational Data Model representation.
1. **Schema Refinement:** Database theory is applied and techniques such as normalization, et cetera are applied to formulate the best possible database without unnecessary fields, redundancies, etc.
1. **Physical Database Design**: The abstract model thus drafted is translated into the physical database and all relations are made.
1. **Application and Security Design**: After designing the database, it makes sense to design the application that may be used in conjunction with this database.
