## Labs

Labs are barely sufficient in any respect. Most labs are quite basic and don't serve to clarify the reasons why a certain thing being done needs to be done. The only lab remotely of any use is the **Bitnami's LAMP Stack**. <br />
Clearing off the labs would take less than 50% of the time allotted. Most instructions are given in the manual of the lab itself. They can just be used as an exploratory measure so as to familiarise oneself with the practical aspect of GCP.


## Quizzes

They had been included as a part of the repository initially but was soon removed since it was pointless and plagiaristic in nature.
