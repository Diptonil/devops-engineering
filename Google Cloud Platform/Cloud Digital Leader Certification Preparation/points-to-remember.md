# Points to Remember

- The exam is all about testing the knowledge of candidates with respect to the breadth of the whole thing rather than the depth. Being a jack of all and master of none is exactly what is needed here.
- There are way too many services. And a lot of them are extremely similar to each other. In most of these cases, however, there is exactly *one line of difference* that segregates the two services (a major difference). The `gcp-services.md` file has all such points in italics.
- Know the difference between *Dataflow*, *Dataproc*, *Cloud Composer* and *Cloud Data Fusion*.
- Active Directory services have not been covered here (because it was far too irritating for me to get back to this service and I was terribly burnt out). But it seems to be quite important as it is a core Cloud concept that every CSP adheres to.
- Every security service literally seems to be the same. And that is one of the most frequently asked part of the exam. Good luck.
