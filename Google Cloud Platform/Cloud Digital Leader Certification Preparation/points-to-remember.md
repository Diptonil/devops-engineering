# Points to Remember


## Before Exam

- The exam is all about testing the knowledge of candidates with respect to the breadth of the whole thing rather than the depth. Being a jack of all and master of none is exactly what is needed here.
- There are way too many services. And a lot of them are extremely similar to each other. In most of these cases, however, there is exactly *one line of difference* that segregates the two services (a major difference). The `gcp-services.md` file has all such points in italics.
- Know the difference between *Dataflow*, *Dataproc*, *Cloud Composer* and *Cloud Data Fusion*.
- Active Directory services have not been covered here (because it was far too irritating for me to get back to this service and I was terribly burnt out). But it seems to be quite important as it is a core Cloud concept that every CSP adheres to.
- Every security service literally seems to be the same. And that is one of the most frequently asked part of the exam. Good luck.
- Know all the serverless services.
- Concepts of DevOps and SRE are focussed on as well at times.
- Know all the Cloud Terminologies to gain ease in understanding all concepts.
- Reading the entire section under the `Cloud Digital Leader Certification Preparation` is easily *more* than enough.
- If there is just one part that has to be read from here before appearing for the exams, it is the GCP Services section.


## During Exam

- Online proctoring is adviced against if there is poor network connectivity, insufficient hardware or too much of external disturbances.
- In case of online proctoring, all required steps would be specified clearly in emails as well as the exam platform.
- In case of any technical failures, extra time would be given and support is generally quite helpful.
- Any forms of cheating would result in termination of exam (for real).
- Read questions very carefully as there are often 2 answers for every question that seem correct. One of them would be a trick option and can be eliminated only by thorough technical knowledge.
- Immediately after the exam ends, the status of pass or fail would be displayed.
