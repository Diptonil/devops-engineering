# Google Cloud Adoption Framework (GCAF)

It is a whitepaper (a report or a guide that helps readers concisely understand about a complex issue, make a decision or solve a problem) that develops new competencies, mentions steps to fill in the knowledge gaps and determines an organization's readiness to adopt Google Cloud. Every CSP has one.


## Composition

- Themes (4): learn, lead, scale, secure
- Maturity Phases (3): tactical, strategic, transformational
- Cloud Maturity Scale: Matrix of themes and phases
- Epics: Workstreams to scope and structure cloud adoption.
- Programs: Logical groupings of Epics.


## Themes

Themes are 4 different areas that the company needs to excel in to be successful with the cloud adoption. They are:
- **Learn**: Ability to augment the IT staff with experienced partners. This refers to the quality and scale of the programs there in place to upskill the technical teams. This has to do with who is engaged? How widespread is the engagement? How effective are the results?
- **Lead**: The degree to which the teams are cross-functional, self-motivated and collaborative. This refers to the extend to which IT teams are supported by a mandate from leadership to migrate to the cloud. This has to do with how the teams are structured, how the executive sponsorship has been attained and how are the cloud projects budgeted, governed and assessed.
- **Scale**: It refers to the scale to which cloud resources are used to reduce operational costs ad automate manual processes and policies. This has to do with how the services are provisioned and the capacity of the workloads allocated.
- **Secure**: It refers to the capability to protect your services from unauthorized and inappropriate access with a multilayered identity-centric security model. This has to do with what technologies are being used and what controls are in place, etc.


## Phases

This is all about the organization's maturity because depending on which phase a company is at, there would be a set of guidelines and advice that should be adopted for progressing further.
- **Tactical** (short term): Individual workloads are in place with no coherent plan. The focus here is simple - getting to the Cloud with minimum costs and technological disruptions. Quick wins but this doesn't guarantee heavy wins since the pros of the Cloud are barely utilized.
- **Strategic** (mid term): A borader vision governs individual workloads. The initial stage of migrating to the Cloud is over. Now is the stage to focus on harnessing the capabilities of Cloud properly. IT teams have become efficient with using Cloud tech, people have begun to embrace change.
- **Transformational** (long term): Cloud operations work smoothly. The focus is now on integrating tha data and insights working together in Cloud. New data is collected and analysed. Predictive analysis using ML technologies may be done. Processes are continuously transformed to keep up with the changes.


## Cloud Maturity Scale

- It is the matrix of themes and phases that helps organizations pinpoint their exact adoption position.
- On the horizontal scale (x-axis) we have the themes. On the vertical scale (y-axis) we have the phases. <br />
|                  | Learn                                   | Lead                                            | Scale                                         | Secure                                             |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Tactical         | Self-taught Third-part reliance         | Teams by function Evangelist project manager    | Slow and risky change                         | Trust in private parties No trust in public sector |
| Strategic        | Organized training Third-party assisted | New cross-functional cloud team                 | Templates used to automate                    | Central identity Hybrid network                    |
| Transformational | Peer learning Third-party staff         | Cross-functional feature teams Greater autonomy | All change is constant Low risk & quick fixes | Zero trust model                                   |


## Epics

- The next logical step after determining where exactly a certain organization is based on the Cloud Maturity Scale is defining Epics.
- Epics are workstreams to scipe and structure cloud adoption.
- They are defined so that they don't overlap.
- They are aligned to manageable groups of stakeholders. They can be broken down into further user stories.
- There are three categories: tech, process and people. Epics reside in these as a Venn Diagram.
    - **Process**: Has instrumentation, cost control, incident management.
    - **Technology**: Networking, resource management.
    - **People**: Communications, behaviours, people operations.
    - **Process** AND **Technology**: CI/CD, IaaS
    - **Process** AND **People**: Teamwork, sponsorship
    - **Technology** AND **People**: Upskills, extrenal experience.
    - **People** AND **Process** AND **Technology**: data management, IAM


## Programs

- Programs are logical groupings of epics that correlate to themes to allow you to focus on specific adoption efforts.
- **Secure** is the secure account setup that is the intersection of all three epics.
- **Scale** is the cloud operational model that is the intersection of tech and process epics.
- **Lead** is the charge management model that is the intersection of people and process epics.
- **Learn** is the training programme model that is the intersection of people and tech epics.


## Technical Account Managers (TAMs)

They are human resource assigned to work with your organizations when paying for GCP's premium support. <br />
They can help us with the GCAF by:
- Train and change management programs.
- Cloud operating model.
- Partner relationships.
- Secure account configuration.


## Cloud Maturity Assessment

It is a guided form that assesses your organizations gainst the Google Cloud Adoption Fraemwork with the 4 themes. It emails to us as the output the maturity phase that the organization is at, among the 3.
