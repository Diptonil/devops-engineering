# Cloud Computing

It is the way of using Information Technology to achieve the five listed goals:
1. Customers get compute resources that are on-demand.
1. Customers may access those resources from anywhere.
1. Providers of the resources allocated them resources out of their pool.
1. Customers pay only for what they use.
1. Customers can scale up or down their demands.

We can say that Cloud is a network of remote servers that are hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data as well as offer multiple utilities on the web rather than using a personal computer on its own for the same purposes, which is theoretically possible but practically unfeasible. <br />
A **Cloud Service Provider** is a company platform that provides multiple cloud services that can be chained together to create different cloud architectures.


## Pros of Cloud Computing

1. **Pay as you go model**: No upfront costs compulsory.
1. **Security**: Cloud services are secure by default because all of that is done by the ones who have designed the services. We do have granularity in choosing the secrurity measures by ourselves as well, if needed.
1. **Global**: Workloads can be launched from anywhere, anytime, to be accessed anywhere by anyone.
1. **Reliability**: We have fault tolerance, redundancy, data replication and backup & disaster recovery.
1. **Scalable**: Scaling up or down, out or in is extremely helpful to manage loads and costs.
1. **Current**: The best-in-class hardware that the providers always have.


## The "Four-Core" Services

There are hundreds of services possible but they are all grouped into four possible categories:
1. **Compute**: A virtual instance capable of acting as the server computer on which various tasks can be run or managed.
1. **Storage**: A place to store file data.
1. **Networking**: A virtual network that has the ability to allow or deny connections and design the routes by which the traffic would route towards the destination.
1. **Databases**: A place to store general data.


## History of Servers

1. **Dedicated Server**: It is a single machine for a single organization. It can run only one application. Very expensive & high maintainance with good security. There still are dedicated servers all around us, although people are slowly gravitating away from it.
1. **Virtual Private Server**: It too is a single machine for a single organization. It is just virtualized into sub-machines. It can run multiple applications due to virtualization into different systems, making effective (and sometimes excessive) use of the resources of that one machine. Virtual Machines introduced first by VMWare had a lot to contribute to this phase.
1. **Shared Hosting**: This got popular in the 2000s by companies like GoDaddy. The philosophy is letting users rent a machine assuming the under-utilization of resources by them. This is extremely cheap and limited. One machine is used by hundreds of users for their purposes. The con is that for a single machine being used, if one person renting the shared hosting overuses the resources, the others suffer.
1. **Cloud Hosting**: This involves multiple machines being used as one system. The system is then abstracted into different services. They're secure, scalable & cost-efficient. The philosophy is that one has to limit to whatever they wish to use & pay for just that. This is the phase where we are at now.


## Types of Services in Cloud

1. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: These are for customers who consume a particular software. It's a product run and managed by the service provider (Salesforce, Google Workspace Suite, Office 365, etc.). We don't need to worry about anything and can just consume the applications and services without any mandatory operational skills. These applications are not installed on our computer and hence belong to the Cloud.
1. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: These are services for developers. It's a platform for deployment of apps managed by the service providers. (Heroku, Beanstalk, Digital Ocean). The developers don't worry about provisioning, configuring or understanding the underlying architecture to utilize the services. It is ideal when a certain degree of autonomy is required in configuring the deployments.
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: These are services for the administrators or DevOps engineers who specialise in the operation of Cloud technologies. Highly configurable, this level is concerned with having the maximum possible autonomy and freedom in configuring the Cloud services at each minute factor.
1. **Serverless Technologies (FaaS)**: Known as 'Functions as a Service', the focus is mainly on generating code and not at all in any part of the deployment process. The Cloud is expected to take care of it by itself. The *Cloud Run* as well as *Cloud Functions* are two such services offered that are serverless. We just write code and deploy it on a server for it to keep on executing.


# Cloud Computing Deployment Models

1. **Public Cloud**: When everything is built atop a cloud provider, the public cloud model is being used.
1. **Private Cloud**: When everything is built atop a company's datacenters and private facilities, the private cloud model is being used. Tools like OpenStack can be used for such models as within premises, a lot of granular functionalities may be observed.
1. **Hybrid Cloud**: Both public and private cloud models are used.
1. **Cross/ Multiple Cloud**: Using more than one cloud service provider. The goal is to reduce costs and get the best of services. Services like Anthos is specially designed to handle workloads that have multi-cloud integrations.


## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
This is a company's expenditure when they choose to allocate resources for their projects. There are 2 types:
1. CAPEX (Capital Expenditure): We spend a lot of money upfront. We guess whatever we are gonna need and spend on hardware, routers, cables, switches, networks, archives, datacenters, personnel training, etc. We may or may not need so many resources (or we may need more). So investing in CAPEX requires knowing exactly what we do.
2. OPEX (Operational Expenditure): We spend on Cloud services rather than on-premise datacenters of maintaining our own cloud. We hence have to only be concerned with non-physical costs of service usage bills, instances, etc. We do not have to spend in equipment. <br />
For the calculation of the TCO, the primary factors to be considered are: qualified personnel, cloud architecture (hybrid, private, public, etc.)


## Kondratiev Waves (Innovation Waves)

Innovation Waves are hypothesized cycle-like phenomena in the global world economy. Each wave that comes irreversibly changes the society on a global scale. It can be measured on a scale of every 50 years.<br />
The latest wave is Cloud technology. Previously we had steam engine and cotton, railway, chemicala nd electrical engineering, etc. Every wave has its own period of expansion, boom, recession and decline. We are at the expanding stage right now.


## Burning Platform

It is a term used to denote a situation in which a company abandons it sold technology for new technology with the uncertainty of success and can be motivated by fear that the success of the organization relies on digital transformation (when it might not be the case as well).
