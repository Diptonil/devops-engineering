# Google Cloud Platform

This section deals with GCP as a Cloud Provider and explores all its features required for a Cloud Engineer as well as with regards to DevOps.<br />
GCP is a platform that encompasses a lot of Google products that is involved in the mainstream Google services. It powers Chrome, Google devices, Maps, Analytics, GMail, Search as well as Workspace. <br />
Google, as of writing has around 160 points of presence that is currently being maintained and expanded.


## Solution Continuum

It is important to realise that there exists more than one solution for a particular problem in the Cloud. An app that may be deployed using *App Engine* might also be deployed using just the *Compute Engine*.<br />
For example, we might employ granularity using *GKE*s, bare metal access to hardware to do the same task that might be done using Serverless or Autoscaling, which is very abstract. So, the same task that can be done using a *Compute Engine* by installing MySQL and starting up the database on it can also be done by creating a Cloud SQL instance.
