## Package Managers

To download and install various dependencies and softwares efficiently, we would need package managers. No matter what environment one is in, it would be fundamental to have at least one.
- `brew`: Mac & Linux.
- `pacman`: Linux.
- `apt`: Linux.
- `scoop`: Windows. Good for developmental needs.
- `chocolatey`: Windows.
