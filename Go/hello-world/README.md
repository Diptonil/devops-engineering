# Basic Hello World

The following considerations are made to create this project:
- In this directory, run `go mod init github.com/Diptonil/devops-engineering/tree/main/Go/hello-world`.
- The `go.mod` is a file that tracks dependencies, versions and other metadata.
- In the root, we are to create a file. We cannot name it anything we want. Since we would only have 1 file, that has to be `main.go` containing the `main()`.
- We can run commands like:
    - `go run .`
    - `go build .`
    - `go vet .`
    - et cetera.
- This is how we use `go mod init` for more complex projects.
