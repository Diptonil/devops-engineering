# Packages & Modules

Essentially, Go packages are contained within Go modules. You can use the pkg.go.dev site to find published modules whose packages have functions you can use in your own code. 
- Packages are a component of a module - a subsection of it. They are contained in a directory. Only the main package is the one without a directory. It is an entrypoint in its own.


## Packages

- Every package has a `main.go`. It need not have a `main()`.


## Module

- Every module must have a `main.go`. It needs to have a `main()`.
