# The Math Library

The math library is used to handle basic math operations, stuff that we have in things like Java's Math class. Tips on using the library:
- When in doubt, try: `go doc math`.
- We have `Floor()`, `Ceil()` and `Round()` for rounding off numbers.
- We have `Max()` and `Min()` for getting out the maxima of the numbers.
- Trigonometric functions are supported.
- Logarithmic and exponential calculations are possible.
- The `Remainder()` function might be helpful in case data is floating.
- When using with predefined variables that are either integers or inferred as an integer, **remember to convert into float64**.
- Function names are all capitalized!
