# Low-Level Design

It is of paramount importance in huge applications that code is written is a way that is *concise*, *maintainable*, *readable* and *standardized*. To ensure such integrities, we have Design Patterns in code. The concepts are very similar for each and every programming language, which makes it universal. Implementation, however, is quite different and would vary from one language to other. For example, certain patterns may seem to be more obvious to catch on to in languages having the concept of functions along with classes rather than just classes (and intefaces, enums, et cetera). <br />
We shall explore basic principles and patters of writing code here. Most patterns are highly specific to the Object Oriented Paradigm of programming. Python shall be the choice of language.
