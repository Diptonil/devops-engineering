# Databases

The system design for a database can be simple or complex, purely dependent upon needs. For simpler cases, we mostly would not deal with things such as sharding or caching. A bit of partitioning would do the trick. <br />
The most important consideration to make here is to not over-engineer a system before it even needs such a thing.


## Sequence

There is a sequence to go through the entire database system design:
1. **Terminologies**
1. **Indexing**
1. **Partitioning**
1. **ACID Theorem**
1. **CAP Theorem**
1. **BASE Theorem**
1. **Replication**
1. **Pooling**
1. **Sharding**
